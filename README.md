## 💼 Current Role

I'm a **Senior Data Scientist** at AMEND Consulting. I wear multiple hats across the full data stack — from **Data Engineering** to **Data Science** to **Business Intelligence** — designing scalable **data pipelines**, crafting **machine learning models** and **operations research algorithms**, and creating compelling **dashboards** that tell stories with data.

## 🏈 Sports Analytics

When I'm not solving client problems, you'll find me diving into **sports analytics**, where I explore the intersection of statistics and athletics. See my work from past **NFL Big Data Bowl** events here:
